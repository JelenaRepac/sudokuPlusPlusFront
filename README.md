On the right side, there is an option to generate Sudoku puzzles of different difficulty levels, as well as to display the top three best results. Meanwhile, on the left side, the current best result is shown.

Furthermore, validation is implemented for entering individual numbers in specific positions. If the number entered is incorrect according to Sudoku rules, it becomes red, alerting the player to change the inputted number. The game starts by clicking on the grid, after which the timer begins, and upon successful completion, the time is saved as the player's result.
